## [](#_summary){.anchor}11.7. Summary {#_summary}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
This chapter explored the characteristics of computer storage devices
and their trade-offs with respect to key measures like access latency,
storage capacity, transfer latency, and cost. Because devices embody
many disparate design and performance trade-offs, they naturally form a
memory hierarchy, which arranges them according to their capacity and
access time. At the top of the hierarchy, primary storage devices like
CPU caches and main memory quickly provide data directly to the CPU, but
their capacity is limited. Lower in the hierarchy, secondary storage
devices like solid-state drives and hard disks offer dense bulk storage
at the cost of performance.
:::

::: paragraph
Because modern systems require both high capacity and good performance,
system designers build computers with multiple forms of storage.
Crucially, the system must manage which storage device holds any
particular chunk of data. Systems aim to store data that's being
actively used in faster storage devices, and they relegate infrequently
used data to slower storage devices.
:::

::: paragraph
To determine which data is being used, systems rely on program data
access patterns known as locality. Programs exhibit two important types
of locality:
:::

::: ulist
-   *Temporal Locality*: Programs tend to access the same data
    repeatedly over time.

-   *Spatial Locality*: Programs tend to access data that is nearby
    other, previously accessed data.
:::

::: paragraph
Locality serves as the basis for CPU caches, which store a small subset
of main memory in fast storage directly on the CPU chip. When a program
attempts to access main memory, the CPU first checks for the data in the
cache; if it finds the data there, it can avoid the more costly trip to
main memory.
:::

::: paragraph
When a program issues a request to read or write memory, it provides the
address of the memory location that it wants to access. CPU caches use
three sections of the bits in a memory address to identify which subset
of main memory a cache line stores:
:::

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  The middle *index* bits of an address map the address to a storage
    location in the cache.

2.  The high-order *tag* bits uniquely identify which subset of memory
    the cache location stores.

3.  The low-order *offset* bits identify which bytes of stored data the
    program wants to access.
:::

::: paragraph
Finally, this chapter concluded by demonstrating how the Cachegrind tool
can enable cache performance profiling for a running program. Cachegrind
simulates a program's interaction with the cache hierarchy and collects
statistics about a program's use of the cache (for example, the hit and
miss rates).
