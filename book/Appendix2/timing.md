## [](#timecmd){.anchor}17.10. Timing {#timecmd}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
Often users want to collect timing information about their programs. For
example, a user may want to measure whether a change to a program
improves its performance. The `time` command is one way to collect
timing information about a process. It takes a command line argument
that is the executable command line of the program or command to time,
and it outputs timing information of the execution of the program or
command. Here is an example of timing a run of the program executable
`gol` that takes two command line arguments (`oscillator_500_500.txt`
and `0`):
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ time ./gol oscillator_500_500.txt 0
    real    0m3.814s
    user    0m3.725s
    sys 0m0.016s
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The timing output is given as three different time values: `real` is the
total execution time, sometimes referred to as wall time because it
corresponds to the time from start to completion as if one was measuring
runtime with a clock; `user` is the portion of total time that the
process spent executing in user-mode; and `sys` is the portion of time
that the process spent executing is system-mode (see [Chapter 13: The
Operating System](../C13-OS/index.html#_the_operating_system){.page} for
more information about user and system mode). Note that the `user` time
plus the `sys` time do not add up to `real` time. This is because during
part of a processes total execution time it is blocked waiting for
certain events like I/O or waiting for its turn to be scheduled by the
OS to run on a CPU core. When a process is blocked, it does not
accumulate `user` or `sys` time, but it does accumulate `real` time.
:::

::: paragraph
In this example, the timed `gol` process spends most of its time running
on a CPU core (its `user + sys` time is almost all of its `real` time).
For applications that do a lot of I/O, their `user + sys` time may be
much less than their `real` time.
:::

::: paragraph
Often, the `-p` option is used with the `time` command. It displays the
timing output in a format that is compliant with a POSIX standard, so
that every system displays the timing results in the same format when
`time` is run with `-p`. This is particularly helpful for writing
programs that do post-processing `time` output (e.g., computing the
average over a set of timed program runs) that will work identically
across systems.
