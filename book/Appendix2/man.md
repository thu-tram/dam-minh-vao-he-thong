## [](#_man_and_the_unix_manual){.anchor}17.2. man and the Unix Manual {#_man_and_the_unix_manual}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
Unix manual pages provide documentation for Unix commands like `ls`, or
`rm`, of system calls, and of library functions. You can read manual
pages using the Unix `man` command. The `apropos` command can be used to
search for Unix commands and library functions related to a topic
supplied by a search pattern given as its command line argument. Many
Unix and C library man pages are also available online, such as at
[kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/).
:::

::: paragraph
The Unix manual is divided into several sections. The first three are
the most commonly used.
:::

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  Section 1 is for commands that you can enter on the command line
    (e.g., `ls`).

2.  Section 2 is for Unix system calls that you can call from program
    code (e.g., `fork`).

3.  Section 3 is for library functions that you can call from your
    program code (e.g., C library functions such as `printf`).
:::

::: paragraph
Run the `man` command to view the manual page with documentation about a
command or function. The man page is opened in a program named `less`.
You can quit `less` by typing `q`, move down a full a page by typing the
space bar, or move up and down one line at a time using the arrow keys.
You can also search for content using `/` syntax similar to Vim search.
:::

::: paragraph
To view the man page for the `ls` command, run:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ man ls
:::
:::

::: paragraph
Sometimes the same name is used for a command and a function. In this
case you can get the correct man page by specifying the part of the
manual in which it is contained. For example, to get the man page for
the system call `write`, which appears in section 2 of the manual, type:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ man 2 write
:::
:::

::: paragraph
You can also read the manual page for `man` to learn more about it:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ man man
:::

### [](#_reading_man_pages){.anchor}17.2.1. Reading man pages {#_reading_man_pages}

::: paragraph
It may not be completely obvious how to read a man page, so lets look at
an example of the `toupper` man page:
:::

::: listingblock

    $ man toupper

::: paragraph
The man page for the `toupper` library function look something like
this:

    TOUPPER(3)          Linux Programmer's Manual          TOUPPER(3)



    NAME
           toupper, tolower - convert letter to upper or lower case

    SYNOPSIS
           #include  <ctype.h>

           int toupper (int c);
           int tolower (int c);

    DESCRIPTION
           toupper()  converts  the letter c to upper case, if possible.

           tolower() converts the letter c to lower case,  if  possible.

           If  c is not an unsigned char value, or EOF, the behavior
           of these functions is undefined.

    RETURN VALUE
           The value returned is that of the converted letter,  or  c
           if the conversion was not possible.

    CONFORMING TO
           ANSI C, BSD 4.3

    BUGS
           The  details of what constitutes an uppercase or lowercase
           letter depend on the current  locale.   For  example,
           the default C locale does not know about umlauts, so
           no conversion is done for them.
           In some non-English locales, there are lowercase letters
           with  no  corresponding  uppercase  equivalent; the German
           sharp s is one example.

    SEE ALSO
           isalpha(3), setlocale(3), locale(7)

    GNU                   1993-04-04                 TOUPPER(3)
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The first line, `TOUPPER(3)`, says that the man page for `toupper` is in
section 3 of the manual.
:::

::: paragraph
The NAME, DESCRIPTION, and RETURN VALUE, parts give short and long
descriptions of what the function does, what its parameters are, and
what it returns:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    NAME
           toupper, tolower - convert letter to upper or lower case

    DESCRIPTION
           toupper()  converts  the letter c to upper case, if possible.

    RETURN VALUE
           The value returned is that of the converted letter,
           or  c if the conversion was not possible.
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The SYNOPSIS part indicates if any header files need to be included to
use this function, and if it is necessary to explicitly link in any
libraries to compile an executable. It also lists the full function
prototype:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    SYNOPSIS
           #include < ctype.h >

           int toupper (int c);
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The synopsis indicates that to call `toupper` a `.c` file must
`#include <ctype.h>`, and that no library needs to be explicitly linked
into a program that calls this function.
:::

::: paragraph
The SEE ALSO part lists other related functions. You can then run `man`
on these to learn more about them (e.g., `man isalpha`).
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    SEE ALSO
           isalpha(3), setlocale(3), locale(7)
:::
:::

::: paragraph
Man pages sometimes include examples of how to call the function.
:::
:::

::: sect2
### [](#_apropos){.anchor}17.2.2. apropos {#_apropos}

::: paragraph
Sometimes you do not know the name of a function or command that you
want to use. The `apropos` command searches Unix manual page
descriptions for key words that match the search pattern you list as a
command line option and lists commands/functions that it thinks are
appropriate matches. For example, if you want to find the name of a
function for getting the current working directory, but you can't
remember the function's name, you can ask apropos:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ apropos "current working directory"
    get_current_dir_name (3) - Get current working directory
    getcwd (3)               - Get current working directory
    getwd (3)                - Get current working directory
:::
:::

::: paragraph
Then you can read some of the man pages for the results to see which one
of these is the one you want:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ man 3 getcwd
:::
