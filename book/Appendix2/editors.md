## [](#_unix_editors){.anchor}17.4. Unix Editors {#_unix_editors}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
Typically, there are often several different editing programs installed
on Unix systems to create and edit text files. Text files are commonly
used for program source code, program data, and documentation. Unix does
not interpret file suffixes to mean anything about a file's content.
However, users typically use suffix naming conventions for many of their
files. For example, a `.c` suffix is the naming convention for C code
source files (e.g., `myprog.c`), and a `.h` suffix is the naming
convention for C header files (e.g., `stdio.h`).
:::

::: paragraph
While it is not important to learn every editor program, users should
learn at least one to create and edit files on Unix systems.
:::

::: paragraph
Vim (vi improved) and Emacs are two examples of editors that are
available on most systems, and vim (or vi) is always available on every
Unix system. These editors have a text-based interface rather than a
GUI-based interface (although both have GUI-based versions as well). In
general, text-based editors require a bit more effort to learn to use
than GUI-based editors that use menus and point-and-click interfaces.
However, text-based editors typically use fewer computer resources to
run, and they are particularly useful when remotely connected to systems
on which you want to edit files.
:::

::: paragraph
There are many online resources for learning both Vim and Emacs. It is
not important to learn both, and there are some strong opinions about
which of Emacs and Vim is best
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war){.bare}).
However, because Vim (or vi) is available on every Unix system, we
present a bit more details on the basics of the vim editor and how to
learn using Vim (and vi). We also include some information about the
basics of Emacs and Nano, including further references for all of three.

### [](#_the_vim_editor){.anchor}17.4.1. The Vim Editor {#_the_vim_editor}

::: paragraph
The `vim` (and `vi`) editor is the most widely available editor on Unix
systems. It is an efficient, lightweight, and powerful text editor that
is easy to use after learning a few basic commands, which you can learn
by running through the `vimtutor` tutorial. `vim` is particularly useful
when working remotely over an ssh connection. It also has many advanced
features and is very configurable through settings in a `.vimrc` config
file.
:::

::: paragraph
It is not necessary to learn all of vim's features; a few basic commands
will get you started with `vim` and allow you to perform most editing
tasks.
:::

::: paragraph
Vim operates in two modes:
:::

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  **insert mode**: keystrokes are interpreted as insertions into the
    file contents at the point of the cursor.

2.  **command or escape mode**: keystrokes are interpreted as vim
    commands that allow a user to do such things as saving, exiting,
    searching, or move the cursor's location in the file.
:::

::: paragraph
To switch from *insert* mode to *command* mode, press the `ESC` key.
:::

::: paragraph
There are many ways to switch from *command* mode to *insert* mode. One
way is to press the `i` key. One of the best ways to learn i\`vim\` is
with `vimtutor`, the Vim tutorial.
:::

::: sect3
#### [](#_vimtutor){.anchor}vimtutor {#_vimtutor}

::: paragraph
The best way to learn the vim editor is to run `vimtutor`:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $  vimtutor
:::
:::

::: paragraph
To get started in vim, we recommend that you focus on the `vimtutor`
sections listed below (the other sections cover more obscure features
that are not necessary). It takes about 20 minutes to run through all of
these lessons.

#### [](#_configuring_vim){.anchor}Configuring vim {#_configuring_vim}

::: paragraph
Optionally, you can configure vim in all kinds of ways. While you're not
required to configure vim to use it, you may find it helpful to
customize the color scheme or adjust some other settings.
:::

::: paragraph
In your home directory add a configuration file for vim, named `.vimrc`.
On start-up, `vim` examines this file to set different configuration
options for the vim session, including setting a color scheme and
default window size.
:::

::: paragraph
Run `ls -a` in your home directory to list all your dot files and to
determine if a `.vimrc` file already exists:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ cd
    $ ls -a ~/       # ~/ is shorthand for /home/you/
:::
:::

::: paragraph
If the `.vimrc` file exits, you can open it in vim and edit it like any
other file:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ vim  .vimrc
:::
:::

::: paragraph
If not, you can create a `.vimrc` in your home directory and copy an
existing example `.vimrc` file of a friends or that you find online into
it. For example:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ pwd
    /home/sarita/
    $ vim  .vimrc
:::

There are many on-line resources information about configuring vim
settings.

### [](#_the_emacs_editor){.anchor}17.4.2. The Emacs Editor {#_the_emacs_editor}

::: paragraph
Emacs is another editor that is almost always available on Unix systems.
It is not necessary to learn and use both Vim and Emacs, but it is
useful to know one, and perhaps to know just a few basics about the
other (at least how to exit each one).
:::

::: paragraph
Unlike Vim, Emacs is a single-mode editor, meaning that it runs in a
single insertion mode where commands, like saving the file, are issued
through special key combinations with the `CTRL`, `ALT`, and `SHIFT`
keys. The main trade-off between Vim and Emacs is that Emacs has more
complicated key sequences than Vim for commands, but it doesn't have the
two modes that the user needs to switch between like Vim does. Emacs is
like a swiss army knife in that it has a rich assortment of macros and
commands that can be used for a wide assortment of tasks (including
features that are not commonly used). For this reason, Emacs is
typically not installed on memory-constrained systems as it usually
requires more memory than an application like Vim.
:::

::: paragraph
To start emacs, just run from the command line on the file you want to
edit. For example, to edit `myprog.c` in emacs:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ emacs myprog.c
:::
:::

::: paragraph
When the user types in regular keystrokes, the characters entered are
added to the file after the cursor.

Like Vim, Emacs has a rich set of commands that support complicated
editing tasks. It is also configurable via a configuration file,
`~/.emacsrc`, in which you can customize functionality and the look of
emacs.

### [](#_the_nano_editor){.anchor}17.4.3. The Nano Editor {#_the_nano_editor}

::: paragraph
Nano is another text editor that is useful for making smaller edits on
files\-\--it is easy to use, but lacks some of the features of Emacs and
Vim that make them useful for larger, more complicated editing tasks.
Nano is also a single-mode editor like Emacs that uses special key
combinations for commands like moving the cursor or saving the file.
:::

::: paragraph
Nano is run similar to Vim and Emacs; to open a file for editing type
`nano` and the file to edit at the command line:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ nano myprog.c
:::
:::

::: paragraph
When you run `nano` it lists some of its most common commands at the
bottom. In its listing, `M-` usually means the `ALT` (meta) key plus
another key, and `C-` is the `CTRL` key. In general, nano's control
sequences for commands are simpler than in emacs. For example, `CTRL-x`
is used to exit nano.

### [](#_setting_your_default_editor){.anchor}17.4.4. Setting your default editor {#_setting_your_default_editor}

::: paragraph
Your default editor program is the one that is automatically opened by
other programs that start an editing session for some of their
functionality. For example, revision control software such as Git starts
an editor for adding comments to a commit. You can see your default text
editor on Linux systems by echo'ing your `EDITOR` and `VISUAL`
environment variables:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ echo $EDITOR
    nano
    $ echo $VISUAL
    nano
:::
:::

::: paragraph
To set your default editor, add or edit the definitions for these two
environment variables to your `.bashrc` file, and then
`source ~/.bashrc` to see the changes. Here is an example to set both to
`vim`:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ vim ~/.bashrc

      export EDITOR=vim
      export VISUAL=vim

    $ source ~/.bashrc
    $ echo $EDITOR
    vim
    $ echo $VISUAL
    vim
:::
:::

::: paragraph
In the [dot files section](dotfiles.html#DotFiles){.page} we talk about
environment variables and `.bashrc` in more detail.
