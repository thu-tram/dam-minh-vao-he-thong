## [](#_what_von_neumann_knew_computer_architecture){.anchor}5. What von Neumann Knew: Computer Architecture {#_what_von_neumann_knew_computer_architecture}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
The term **computer architecture** may refer to the entire hardware
level of the computer. However, it is often used to refer to the design
and implementation of the digital processor part of the computer
hardware, and we focus on the computer processor architecture in this
chapter.
:::

::: paragraph
The **central processing unit** (CPU, or processor) is the part of the
computer that executes program instructions on program data. Program
instructions and data are stored in the computer's random access memory
(RAM). A particular digital processor implements a specific
**instruction set architecture** (ISA), which defines the set of
instructions and their binary encoding, the set of CPU registers, and
the effects of executing instructions on the state of the processor.
There are many different ISAs, including SPARC, IA32, MIPS, ARM, ARC,
PowerPC, and x86 (the latter including IA32 and x86-64). A
**microarchitecture** defines the circuitry of an implementation of a
specific ISA. Microarchitecture implementations of the same ISA can
differ as long as they implement the ISA definition. For example, Intel
and AMD produce different microprocessor implementations of IA32 ISA.
:::

::: paragraph
Some ISAs define a **reduced instruction set computer** (RISC), and
others define a **complex instruction set computer** (CISC). RISC ISAs
have a small set of basic instructions that each execute quickly; each
instruction executes in about a single processor clock cycle, and
compilers combine sequences of several basic RISC instructions to
implement higher-level functionality. In contrast, a CISC ISA's
instructions provide higher-level functionality than RISC instructions.
CISC architectures also define a larger set of instructions than RISC,
support more complicated addressing modes (ways to express the memory
locations of program data), and support variable-length instructions. A
single CISC instruction may perform a sequence of low-level
functionality and may take several processor clock cycles to execute.
This same functionality would require multiple instructions on a RISC
architecture.
:::

::: title
The History of RISC versus CISC
:::

::: paragraph
In the early 1980s, researchers at Berkeley and Stanford universities
developed RISC through the Berkeley RISC project and the Stanford MIPS
project. David Patterson of Berkeley and John Hennessy of Stanford won
the 2017 Turing Award^1^ (the highest award in computing) for their work
developing RISC architectures.
:::

::: paragraph
At the time of its development, the RISC architecture was a radical
departure from the commonly held view that ISAs needed to be
increasingly complex to achieve high performance. \"The RISC approach
differed from the prevailing complex instruction set computer (CISC)
computers of the time in that it required a small set of simple and
general instructions (functions a computer must perform), requiring
fewer transistors than complex instruction sets and reducing the amount
of work a computer must perform.\"^2^
:::

::: paragraph
CISC ISAs express programs in fewer instructions than RISC, often
resulting in smaller program executables. On systems with small main
memory, the size of the program executable is an important factor in the
program's performance, since a large executable leaves less RAM space
available for other parts of a running program's memory space.
Microarchitectures based on CISC are also typically specialized to
efficiently execute the CISC variable-length and higher-functionality
instructions. Specialized circuitry for executing more complex
instructions may result in more efficient execution of specific
higher-level functionality, but at the cost of requiring more complexity
for all instruction execution.
:::

::: paragraph
In comparing RISC to CISC, RISC programs contain more total instructions
to execute, but each instruction executes much more efficiently than
most CISC instructions, and RISCs allow for simpler microarchitecture
designs than CISC. CISC programs contain fewer instructions, and CISC
microarchitectures are designed to execute more complicated instructions
efficiently, but they require more complex microarchitecture designs and
faster clock rates. In general, RISC processors result in more efficient
design and better performance. As computer memory sizes have increased
over time, the size of the program executable is less important to a
program's performance. CISC, however, has been the dominant ISA due in
large part to it being implemented by and supported by industry.
:::

::: paragraph
Today, CISC remains the dominant ISA for desktop and many server-class
computers. For example, Intel's x86 ISAs are CISC-based. RISC ISAs are
more commonly seen in high-end servers (e.g. SPARC) and in mobile
devices (e.g. ARM) due to their low power requirements. A particular
microarchitecture implementation of a RISC or CISC ISA may incorporate
both RISC and CISC design under the covers. For example, most CISC
processors use microcode to encode some CISC instructions in a more
RISC-like instruction set that the underlying processor executes, and
some modern RISC instruction sets contain a few more complex
instructions or addressing modes than the initial MIPS and Berkeley RISC
instruction sets.
:::
:::
:::

::: paragraph
All modern processors, regardless of their ISA, adhere to the von
Neumann architecture model. The general-purpose design of the von
Neumann architecture allows it to execute any type of program. It uses a
stored-program model, meaning that the program instructions reside in
computer memory along with program data, and both are inputs to the
processor.

This chapter introduces the von Neumann architecture and the ancestry
and components that underpin modern computer architecture. We build an
example digital processor (CPU) based on the von Neumann architecture
model, design a CPU from digital circuits that are constructed from
logic gate building blocks, and demonstrate how the CPU executes program
instructions.
