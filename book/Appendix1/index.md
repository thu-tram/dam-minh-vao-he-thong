::: paragraph
This appendix presents an overview of C programming written for students
who have some experience programming in another language. It's
specifically written for Java programmers and uses a few Java examples
for comparison purposes. However, it should be useful as an introduction
to C programming for anyone with basic programming experience in any
language.
:::

::: paragraph
C is a high-level programming language like other languages you might
know, such as Python, Java, Ruby, or C++. It's an imperative and a
procedural programming language, which means that a C program is
expressed as a sequence of statements (steps) for the computer to
execute and that C programs are structured as a set of functions
(procedures). Every C program must have at least one function, the
`main` function, which contains the set of statements that execute when
the program begins.
:::

::: paragraph
The C programming language is less abstracted from the computer's
machine language than some other languages with which you might be
familiar. This means that C doesn't have support for object-oriented
programming, nor does it have a rich set of high-level programming
abstractions (like String and ArrayList) and large set of class
libraries for programmers to use, nor does it have support for garbage
collection and exceptions. As a result, if you want to use a data
structure like a dictionary in your C program, you need to implement it
yourself, as opposed to just using one already implemented in a Java
class library.
:::

::: paragraph
C's lack of high-level abstractions might make it seem like a less
appealing programming language to use. However, being less abstracted
from the underlying machine makes C easier for a programmer to see and
understand the relationship between a program's code and the computer's
execution of it. C programmers retain more control over how their
programs execute on the hardware, and they can write code that runs more
efficiently than equivalent code written using the higher-level
abstractions provided by other programming languages. In particular,
they have more control over how their programs manage memory, which can
have a significant impact on performance. Thus, C remains the *de facto*
language for computer systems programming where low-level control and
efficiency are crucial.
:::

::: paragraph
We use C in this book because of its expressiveness of program control
and its relatively straightforward translation to assembly and machine
code that a computer executes. This chapter introduces programming in C
to readers familiar with Java, beginning with an overview of C's
features and how they related to the Java programming language. [Chapter
2](../C2-C_depth/index.html#_a_deeper_dive_into_c_programming){.page}
then describes C's features in more detail.
