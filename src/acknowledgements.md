## Early Adopters

An alpha release of *Dive into Systems* was piloted at West Point in
Fall 2018; The beta release of the textbook was piloted at West Point
and Swarthmore College in Spring 2019. In Fall 2019, *Dive into Systems*
launched its Early Adopter Program, which enabled faculty around the
United States to pilot the stable release of *Dive into Systems* at
their institutions. The Early Adopter Program is a huge help to the
authors, as it helps us get valuable insight into student and faculty
experiences with the textbook. We use the feedback we receive to improve
and strengthen the content of *Dive into Systems*, and are very thankful
to everyone who completed our student and faculty surveys.
