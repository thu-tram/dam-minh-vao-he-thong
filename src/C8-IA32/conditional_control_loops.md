## 8.4. Conditional Control and Loops 

This section covers assembly instructions for [conditionals and
loops](../C1-C_intro/conditionals.html#_conditionals_and_loops).
Recall that conditional statements enable coders to modify program
execution based on the result of a conditional expression. The compiler
translates conditionals into assembly instructions that modify the
instruction pointer (`%eip`) to point to an address that is not the next
one in the program sequence.
